-- ds.heading-large: `lets-auth`: Auth For `fastn` Apps

You can add authentication to your fastn powered sites by using
`lets-auth.fifthtry.site` package.

You can create a new site using `lets-auth` using `lets-auth-template` on
FifthTry.

If you want to add auth to an existing website do the following:

-- ds.heading-medium: Add Dependency And "mount" Auth App

You will have to use the `lets-auth.fifthtry.site` package.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- import: fastn

\-- fastn.package: your-package

\-- fastn.dependency: lets-auth.fifthtry.site

\;; NOTE: you MUST use this auto-import alias or things won't work
\-- fastn.auto-import: lets-auth.fifthtry.site as lets-auth

\-- fastn.app: Auth App
mount-point: /-/auth/
package: lets-auth.fifthtry.site

-- ds.copy-regular:

Note that we are "mounting" the `lets-auth.fifthtry.site` package at `/-/auth/`
URL. [Learn more about `fastn.app` feature in `fastn`
here](https://fastn.com/app/).

-- ds.heading-medium: Using Auth

Once you have done this setup, when you restart your `fastn` server, the app
would be ready for you. We will create `fastn_user` etc tables for you in you
`sqlite` db transparently. You can visit `/-/auth/signin/` to signin or
`/-/auth/signin/` to create a new account. You can hit `/-/auth/logout/` to
logout.

A sample app file using the auth feature:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\;; echo the name of currently logged in user if someone is logged in
\-- ftd.text: $lets-auth.user.name
if: { lets-auth.user != NULL }

\;; show a logout url if user is logged in
\-- ftd.text: logout
if: { lets-auth.user != NULL }
link: /-/auth/logout/

\;; if user is not logged in show the link to login page
\-- ftd.text: login
if: { lets-auth.user == NULL }
link: /-/auth/signin/

-- ds.heading-medium: `lets-auth.user`

`lets-auth.user` is an `optional `lets-auth.user-details`, which is defined as:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- record user-details:
string name:
string email:
string identity:
boolean verified-email:
